Synesthesia Symphony
====================

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up#Types" target="_blank">danmaku</a> coded with HTML5 Canvas.

For this project I used my very own <a href="https://github.com/shippingsoon/Finite-State-Machine" target="_blank">finite state machine</a> and the <a href="http://www.adequatelygood.com/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth.html" target="_blank">javascript module pattern</a> to keep the source code organized and manageable. To make things even more maintainable, I made sure that each module and sub-module was under 250 lines of code. This is an arbitrary limit but prevents modules from becoming too ambiguous or complex.
